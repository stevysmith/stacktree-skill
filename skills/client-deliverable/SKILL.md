name: stacktree-client-deliverable
description: Hand a finished report or proposal to a client at a private link. Use when the user says "send this to the client", "share this with <company>", "this is for a customer", or is handing a polished deliverable to someone outside their team. Produces a page in the Client deliverable shape (a clean editorial "sheet" prepared-for-a-named-recipient), gates it to the recipient, removes the auto-expiry so the link stays live, and refuses to ship if the page leaks PII.

# stacktree-client-deliverable

Publish a client-facing deliverable to **stacktr.ee** and return a private link the
client can open in a browser, no account needed. This is the publish path for the
`client-deliverable` job: work that leaves the building and should look finished,
stay reachable, and only open for the intended recipient.

## When to invoke

- User is handing a finished artifact to a named client or customer ("send this to
  Acme", "this goes to the client tomorrow").
- The page is a deliverable, not a scratch draft: a proposal, audit, report, or
  pitch.
- The recipient is outside the user's own org and will not have a Stacktree account.

For an agent-generated report meant for "anyone with the link", use
`stacktree-agent-run-report`. For a dated digest refreshed in place, use
`stacktree-daily-brief`. For a public status page, use `stacktree-status-dashboard`.

## The page shape

Produce a single self-contained HTML document in the Client deliverable shape: a
centered white `.sheet` with a `.topbar` (the studio/sender name on the left, a
`.pill` reading "Private deliverable" on the right), then a `.pad` body with an
`.eyebrow` "Prepared for <Client>", an `<h1>` title, a `.lede`, and a `.meta` row
(prepared by, date, version). Use `.section` blocks for Overview, the one
recommendation (in a `.callout`), an at-a-glance `<dl>`, and next steps
(`<ol class="steps">`). Close with a `.foot`. The published page is what the client
sees, so the craft is the point: keep it editorial, content-first, no broken
assets. The canonical reference is the `client-deliverable` template in the
Stacktree app (`apps/web/src/templates.ts`); match its structure and restraint.

## Required env

```
STACKTREE_API_KEY=stk_live_...   # generate at https://app.stacktr.ee/api-keys
```

A client deliverable should publish under the user's own account so they keep
ownership and can revoke it later. If no key is set, ask for one rather than
falling back to an anonymous upload (anonymous uploads expire in 24h, which is
wrong for a deliverable). See the root `stacktree-publish` skill for the
pay-to-provision path when there is genuinely no human and no key.

## The judgment this skill encodes

1. **It must not auto-delete.** Publish with `--expires-never` (or `set_expiry` to
   never). A link that 404s a week after you send it is worse than not sending it.
   Only set an expiry if the user wants access to lapse on purpose (e.g. "this quote
   is valid 30 days"), then set it to that date, not the 7-day default.

2. **It must be gated to the recipient, not the whole internet.** The unlisted token
   alone is "anyone with the link", and links get forwarded. Pick the gate from what
   the user has:
   - **Recipient email or company domain known:** use the email gate
     (`set_email_gate`). The client enters their email, gets a one-time code, and is
     in. This ties access to a person and gives the user a record of who opened it.
   - **Only a side channel (the user will pass a secret over Slack/SMS):** use a
     password (`--password` or `set_password`). Generate a strong one, never reuse
     the user's own secrets, and surface it on its own line so it travels separately
     from the link.
   The template's footer line ("This link is unguessable. Add a password if it
   should be.") is the prompt: act on it, do not ship a bare link for a real
   deliverable unless the user says "anyone with the link is fine".

3. **It must not leak PII.** Keep the PII scan in `block` mode (the default). Client
   deliverables are exactly where an embedded API key, internal thread, or customer
   record does real damage. If the scan trips, stop and show the user what it caught
   before relaxing anything. Only drop to `--pii-check warn` when the user confirms
   the flagged content is intentional and safe (e.g. the client's own contact
   details on the proposal).

4. **The URL can read as professional.** A raw `stacktr.ee/p/<token>/` link is fine
   and private, but for an external deliverable a custom domain (e.g.
   `proposals.theiragency.com`) reads better. Custom domains are a paid Pro unlock,
   not a publish flag, and there is no MCP tool for the mapping, so point the user to
   <https://stacktr.ee/x402> or the dashboard to enable it. Do not block the hand-off
   on it; ship the private link now and offer the domain as a follow-up.

## Steps

1. Build the deliverable as a complete HTML document in the page shape above. If you
   only have Markdown or a fragment, wrap and style it so it renders standalone.
2. Decide the gate from what the user has. If unclear, ask one short question: "Do
   you have the client's email, or will you send them a password separately?"
3. Publish with no expiry and the PII scan on, via the publish helper:
   ```bash
   echo "$DELIVERABLE_HTML" | bash scripts/publish.sh --expires-never
   ```
   Equivalent MCP path: `publish_html` with expiry set to never. Capture the `id`
   and `url`.
4. Apply the gate:
   - Email gate: `set_email_gate` on the returned id with the client's email or
     `@their-domain.com`.
   - Password: pass `--password <generated>` in step 3, or call `set_password`
     after. Prefer generating the password over asking the user to invent one.
5. Optionally `set_agentation` (or `--agentation`) if the client should be able to
   leave inline feedback (useful for a draft-for-review; skip it for a final, signed
   deliverable).
6. Reply with: the link, the gate type and how the client gets in (the allowed
   email/domain, or the password on its own line), the fact that it will not expire,
   and any PII warning that was surfaced.

## What to tell the user

State plainly who can open it (the gate), that the link will stay live, and what the
PII scan caught if anything. If they wanted a custom domain, note it is a one-time
Pro unlock and offer to walk them through it rather than holding up the hand-off.
